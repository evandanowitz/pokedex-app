# pokédex-app

The Pokédex application project displays a list of 150 Pokémon that have been dynamically created in JavaScript and are sourced from an external API. When a user clicks on one of the Pokémon buttons, a modal will appear displaying details of the selected Pokémon such as name, height, type(s) and an image. To get rid of the modal, click anywhere outside of the modal, the "X" in the top-right corner, or press the "Esc" key on your keyboard.

The goal behind this project was to create a function Pokédex app by taking my current HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files and implementing Bootstrap to create modals, navbars, etc.

To get the project running, simply click/visit the URL "evandanowitz.github.io/simple-js-app/" and the application will deploy.

This project is dependent upon HTML, CSS, JavaScript and one of JavaScript's most popular libraries: Bootstrap. It was debugged using ESlint, minified using toptal.com, and reformatted with the Prettier plugin.

The project uses the following API: https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/?limit=150

Have fun and enjoy!
